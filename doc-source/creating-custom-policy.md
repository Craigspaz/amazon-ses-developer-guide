If you want to create a custom policy and attach it to an identity, you have the following options:
+ Using the Amazon SES API – Create a policy in a text editor and then attach the policy to the identity by using the [PutIdentityPolicy API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/APIReference/API_PutIdentityPolicy.html)\.
+ Using the Amazon SES console – Create a custom policy in a text editor and attach it to an identity by following the steps in [Creating a custom policy](sending-authorization-identity-owner-tasks-policy.md#sending-authorization-identity-owner-tasks-identity-policy-custom)\.
